#### Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.

Solution: 

(SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) FROM STATION
ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) DESC, CITY ASC
LIMIT 1)
UNION ALL
(SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) FROM STATION
ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) ASC, CITY ASC
LIMIT 1)

Result:
Marine On Saint Croix 21
Amo 3

Comments: 
1. The SQL UNION ALL operator is used to combine the result sets of 2 or more SELECT statements. It does not remove duplicate rows between the various SELECT statements (all rows are returned).
2. LIMIT: MYSQL uses LIMIT clause to specify the number of records to return, some databases use the TOP clause.
